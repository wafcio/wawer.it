                            I was part of a backend team responsible for building and maintaining systems related to finances and payments for a global chauffeur service platform. Our focus was on automating and optimizing payment flows between customers, drivers, and partner companies across multiple currencies and regions. I contributed to the development of invoicing systems, payout processes, reconciliation tools, and financial reporting features, ensuring accuracy, scalability, and compliance with financial regulations. We also worked closely with other teams to integrate third-party payment providers and improve the transparency and reliability of the financial operations.

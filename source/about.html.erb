        <p>
          I'm a Senior Ruby on Rails Developer with over 13 years of experience building web applications that scale, last, and make sense. I care about clean architecture, meaningful abstractions, and solving real problems with practical code. I've led features, mentored teams, and delivered systems that keep running - even when no one's watching.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lately, I've been focused on solving the right problems, guiding others as they grow, and finding the most effective paths to deliver real value — on time, and with purpose. I enjoy the balance of thinking clearly, building simply, and helping teams move forward with confidence.
